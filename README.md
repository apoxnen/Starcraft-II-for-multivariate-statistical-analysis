**Multivariate analysis of SC2 match replay data.**

The research questions that motivated this work are:

- What are the significant predictors of a player's league?
- Which variables of the in-game dataset provide the best clues for in which league a player is?
- How accurately can a players league be predicted by performing analysis on this dataset?

The data used in this project can be found [here][1].
