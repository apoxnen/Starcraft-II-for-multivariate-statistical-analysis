How theoretical?
    - Not theoretical at all. Do something practical.

How to justify?
    - No need to explain the methods theoretically, just mention what you used and why.
    - two to three sentences is enough

R-codes? Do you need to include them?
    - No, no need to write smart code, just make it work.
    - All packages usable.

Univariate and bivariate analysis?
    - Univariate analysis: Focus on one type of data (e.g. unemployment rate in some countries), calculate means etc.
    - Do not select data with a lot of variables, then you have to do univariate analysis to each of them.
    - Bivariate analysis: Use to explore 2-by-2 dependencies in variables. (e.g. scatter plot by two interesting variables)
    - Mosaic plot may be useful.
    - R-plot cookbook

How long?
    - Range of length for max points is four to ten pages. Do not write more than ten.
    - Use a cover page with name, student number and title.

Where to get the data?
    - Kaggle.com
    - UN
    - WHO
    - DECD
    - Statistics Finland (tilastokeskus)
    - Finnish Cancer Registry
    - Collect your own data

Time-series data?
    - Yes you may but it is way beyond the scope of this course.
